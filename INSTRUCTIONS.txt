## How to Edit a Product

### To Change a Price:
Find the product and change the "price" value:
```
"price": 149.99,    ← Change this number
```

### To Mark as Sold Out:
Change "inStock" to false and "stockCount" to 0:
```
"inStock": false,
"stockCount": 0,
```

### To Update Stock Quantity:
Simply change the stockCount number:
```
"stockCount": 15,    ← Change this number
```

### To Add a Sale Price:
Add an "oldPrice" and update the current price:
```
"price": 69.99,
"oldPrice": 89.99,    ← This shows the original price crossed out
"badge": "Sale"        ← This adds a red "Sale" badge
```

### To Mark as New Product:
Change the badge to "New":
```
"badge": "New"
```

### To Remove Badge:
Set badge to null:
```
"badge": null
```

## How to Add a New Product

Copy an existing product block and paste it at the end (before the closing ]). Don't forget to:
1. Add a comma after the previous product
2. Give it a unique ID number
3. Update all the fields

Example:
```json
{
  "id": 31,
  "name": "Your New Product",
  "category": "electronics",
  "price": 99.99,
  "oldPrice": null,
  "description": "Description of your product",
  "image": "https://via.placeholder.com/300x300/4A90E2/ffffff?text=New+Product",
  "rating": 5,
  "reviews": 0,
  "inStock": true,
  "stockCount": 10,
  "badge": "New"
}
```

## How to Delete a Product

Simply delete the entire product block (everything between { and }) and the comma before or after it.

## IMPORTANT TIPS

✓ Always use double quotes " not single quotes '
✓ Numbers don't need quotes (price: 99.99)
✓ Text needs quotes (name: "Product Name")
✓ true, false, and null don't need quotes
✓ Use commas between items, but NOT after the last item
✓ If you break the JSON format, the website won't load products
✓ Keep a backup copy before making big changes!

## Testing Your Changes

1. Save the products.json file
2. Refresh your website in the browser
3. Your changes should appear immediately!

If products don't show up, you may have a JSON formatting error.
Use a JSON validator tool online to check: https://jsonlint.com/
